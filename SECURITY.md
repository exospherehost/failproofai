# Security Policy

failproofai is an npm package that installs hooks into AI coding agents (Claude
Code, Codex, and others) and runs locally in developers' environments, observing
and gating agent actions. A compromised dependency would therefore run on our
users' machines, inside their agent sessions — so we treat our supply chain as
part of our users' trust boundary. This document covers how to report a
vulnerability and how our dependency supply-chain scanning works.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately — do **not** open a public issue.

- Preferred: open a [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/FailproofAI/failproofai/security/advisories/new)
  via GitHub Security Advisories.
- Or email **failproofai@exosphere.host**.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and will keep you updated as
we investigate and ship a fix. Please give us a reasonable window to remediate
before any public disclosure.

## Supply-chain scanning

Every pull request — including automated Dependabot dependency bumps — is scanned
for supply-chain threats before it can merge, via two complementary layers.

### 1. OSV-Scanner — the blocking CI gate

[`.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml`](.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml) runs
[OSV-Scanner](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/) against the resolved
dependency tree (`bun.lock`). It checks every direct and transitive package
against [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev), which aggregates GitHub/npm security
advisories **and** the [OpenSSF malicious-packages feed](https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages)
(confirmed malware: typosquats, account-takeover injections, and the like).

**Policy: block on any finding.** The gate fails on *any* known-vulnerable or
malicious package in the tree — not just newly introduced ones. It runs on every
PR, on pushes to `main`, and weekly (to catch advisories disclosed after a
dependency was already merged).

### 2. Socket — behavioral early-warning

OSV-Scanner is advisory-based: it can only flag threats already cataloged. To
catch *novel* attacks (malicious install scripts, suspicious network/filesystem
access, obfuscation, sudden maintainer changes) before they reach any advisory
database, we use [Socket](https://socket.dev) via its GitHub App, which comments
on PRs that introduce risky dependency behavior. Socket is advisory (it
comments); the deterministic *blocking* gate is OSV-Scanner.

## Triaging a failed scan

When the OSV-Scanner gate fails on a PR:

1. **Prefer fixing it.** Bump the affected dependency to a patched version. For a
   transitive dependency that a parent pins to a vulnerable version, add a minimal
   [`overrides`](package.json) entry (as we do for `postcss`) and let CI validate
   the build.
2. **Only if there is no fix**, add a justified, time-boxed entry to
   [`osv-scanner.toml`](osv-scanner.toml) (`id`, `reason`, `ignoreUntil`). Never
   blanket-ignore. Re-review entries when their `ignoreUntil` date passes.

## Maintainer setup (one-time)

These steps live outside the repo and require admin access:

1. **Install the [Socket GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/socket-security)** on
   the repository to enable behavioral PR comments.
2. **Make the OSV-Scanner check required**: in branch protection for `main`, add
   the OSV-Scanner job (shown as `OSV-Scanner`) as a required status check, so a
   red scan blocks merge.
3. *(Optional)* For a Socket CI gate in addition to the App, add a
   `SOCKET_SECURITY_API_KEY` repository secret and the Socket CI action — deferred
   until tuned, since behavioral findings can have false positives.
