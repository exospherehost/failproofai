# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixes
- Fix `mintlify validate` failing on `docs/de/dashboard.mdx` after #228 added German „..." quotation marks inside two `<Tab title="…">` attributes — the inner straight `"` ended the JSX attribute value, then the leftover `"` produced an `Unexpected character "` parse error. Drop the inner quotes (matching how every other locale renders the tab labels) so the docs CI job passes again.

## 0.0.9 — 2026-04-28

### Features
- Surface the Slack community invite alongside the existing GitHub and docs links: add a `💬 Slack` line to the CLI `--help` banner (`bin/failproofai.mjs`) and the `dev` / `start` launch banner (`scripts/launch.ts`), plus a `Join our Slack` entry in the in-app `Reach Us` dropdown (`components/reach-developers.tsx`). Uses the existing `https://join.slack.com/t/failproofai/...` invite already linked from the README and docs sidebar (#225).
- Activity dashboard now has a CLI filter alongside event-type, policy, and session-id filters; URL is preserved as `?cli=claude|codex`. Codex sessions in the activity feed are also clickable: the session route now falls back to `~/.codex/sessions/<…>.jsonl` when the Claude lookup misses, and the existing log viewer renders Codex transcripts (user prompts, assistant messages, exec_command tool calls with stdout/stderr and durations) by mapping every record type. Transcript discovery (`findCodexTranscript`) lives in a shared `lib/codex-sessions.ts` module reused by the hook hot path (#226).
- Add OpenAI Codex hook integration. Install hooks for Codex via `failproofai policies --install --cli codex` (or `--cli claude codex` for both). Supports all six documented Codex hook events (`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`) and writes to `~/.codex/hooks.json` (user) / `<cwd>/.codex/hooks.json` (project). Codex's `PermissionRequest` is wired through `policy-evaluator.ts` to emit the `hookSpecificOutput.decision.behavior` shape per Codex docs; `block-sudo` now also fires for `PermissionRequest` events. Stdin event names arrive snake_case (`pre_tool_use`) and are canonicalized to PascalCase before policy lookup. Permission-mode tracking for Codex reads `approval_policy` from the active session transcript (`~/.codex/sessions/<…>.jsonl`). New `--cli` flag is interactive by default — detects installed agent CLIs and prompts when both are present. Telemetry now tags every hook decision with the originating CLI; activity dashboard rows show a per-CLI badge. `isAgentInternalPath` / `isAgentSettingsFile` generalized to also cover `~/.codex/` and `.codex/hooks.json` so existing path-protection rules apply to Codex out of the box (#220).

### Fixes
- Add a trailing blank line after the `Enabled N policy(ies): …` summary printed by `failproofai policies --install`. With 39+ enabled policies the line wraps to several rows of comma-separated names and previously ran straight into the `Failproof AI hooks installed for …` confirmations, making the install output hard to scan (#224).
- Replace the `[B]oth / [C]laude / [D]codex` text prompt that fires when both agent CLIs are detected during `failproofai policies --install` with an interactive arrow-key single-select. Visual style mirrors the existing policy selector (cursor pointer, dim/bold rows, footer hint line); options are `Both`, `Claude Code only`, `OpenAI Codex only`. Non-TTY behaviour is unchanged (defaults to all detected CLIs) (#223).
- Switch this repo's own `.claude/settings.json` hook commands from a relative `bun ./bin/failproofai.mjs --hook ...` to `bun $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/bin/failproofai.mjs --hook ...`. Claude Code spawns hooks with the live session CWD, which drifts whenever the agent `cd`s into a subdirectory, so the relative form failed with `Module not found "./bin/failproofai.mjs"` after any `cd subdir && …` Bash call. Mirrors the stable-root pattern already used by `block-read-outside-cwd` (`src/hooks/builtin-policies.ts`).
- Fix `mintlify validate` failing on `docs/ar/built-in-policies.mdx` by re-wrapping `origin/<baseBranch>` in backticks. The Arabic translation dropped the surrounding inline-code markers in one paragraph, so MDX parsed `<baseBranch>` as an unclosed JSX tag and the docs CI job errored out.

### Docs
- Bump built-in policy count from 32 to 39 in `README.md` and the 14 translated `docs/i18n/README.*.md` files to reflect the seven Infra Commands policies added in #202. The reference doc (`docs/built-in-policies.mdx` and its localized counterparts) was already correct (#207).

## 0.0.8 — 2026-04-27

### Fixes
- Fix `require-pr-before-stop` falsely denying after a squash-merge or rebase-merge: GitHub creates a new commit on the base branch with rewritten parentage, so the original branch commit is never an ancestor of `main` and the post-merge `git log` / `git diff` reconciliation never converges. The policy now short-circuits to `allow` when `gh pr view --json state` returns `MERGED`, mirroring the fix shape from #196 for `require-no-conflicts-before-stop`. Also surfaces whenever `main` is auto-modified after merge — e.g. release workflows that auto-bump versions (#204).

## 0.0.7 — 2026-04-27

### Features
- Add `Infra Commands` category with seven opt-in policies: `block-kubectl`, `block-terraform`, `block-aws-cli`, `block-gcloud`, `block-az-cli`, `block-helm`, and `block-gh-pipeline`. Each denies invocations of its CLI by default and supports an `allowPatterns` param so users can carve out read-only subcommands (e.g. `kubectl get *`, `terraform plan`, `aws s3 ls *`). `block-gh-pipeline` only matches mutating subcommands (`workflow run`, `pr merge`, `release create`, etc.) so read-only `gh` calls used by other policies continue to work (#202).

### Fixes
- Skip `require-no-conflicts-before-stop` entirely when no OPEN PR exists for the current branch (or when `gh` CLI is unavailable to check). The policy no longer runs Layer 1's local `git merge-tree` probe in those cases — without a confirmable merge target there is nothing to enforce (#198).
- Resolve project policy config (`.failproofai/`) by walking up from the live CWD to find the nearest project root, instead of looking only at the exact session cwd. Stop-gating policies (`require-pr-before-stop`, `block-read-outside-cwd`, etc.) no longer silently disable when Claude `cd`s into a subdirectory. Also covers `customPoliciesPath` and project convention discovery in `custom-hooks-loader.ts` (#200).

## 0.0.6 — 2026-04-27

### Features
- Add cloud platform client: `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `relay start|stop|status`, and `sync` subcommands. Hook events are appended to a local queue and streamed to the failproofai cloud server via a background relay daemon that lazy-starts from the hook handler and survives reboots (#132)
- Add `require-no-conflicts-before-stop` builtin workflow policy that denies Stop until the current branch merges cleanly with the base branch. Runs a local `git merge-tree` probe (names the conflicted files) and an optional `gh pr view --json mergeable` probe that catches conflicts a stale local `origin/<base>` would miss (#176)
- Add policy namespace support. Built-in policies now live under the `exospherehost/` namespace; flat names in user configs (e.g. `"sanitize-jwt"`) auto-resolve to the default namespace, so existing configs keep working unchanged. Custom and third-party policies can declare their own namespace (e.g. `myorg/foo`) without colliding with builtins (#196)

### Docs
- Add demo GIF to README (#178)
- Document the policy namespace concept and update built-in policy count from 30 to 32 (#196)

### Fixes
- Fix `require-no-conflicts-before-stop` falsely denying when the PR is already merged or closed: GitHub returns `mergeable=UNKNOWN` for non-OPEN PRs, which the policy was treating as "still computing → wait and retry". The policy now requests `state` and short-circuits to allow when the PR is not OPEN (#196)
- Stop stderr leakage from workflow policies (`require-push-before-stop`, `require-pr-before-stop`, `require-ci-green-before-stop`, etc.): git probes that are expected to sometimes fail no longer leak "fatal: Needed a single revision" or similar messages to the user's terminal (#132)
- `block-read-outside-cwd` now uses `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (the stable project root) instead of the live hook `cwd`, which drifts when Claude `cd`s into a subdirectory. Reads at the project root are no longer wrongly denied after a `cd`. Falls back to `ctx.session.cwd` when that variable is unset (#134)
- Shrink the npm package by excluding sharp from the Next.js standalone build (unused — image optimization is disabled) and stripping docs, tests, and sourcemaps from the bundled `node_modules`. Tarball drops from ~20 MB to under a few MB (#136)
